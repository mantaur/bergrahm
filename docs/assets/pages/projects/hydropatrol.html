            <h1>Hackathon</h1>
            <p> In september of 2020 I, Mark, participated in a hackathon organized by Copernicus with 4 other team
                members. 
                Despite no team member having any previous experiences with GIS systems or satellite programs, our
                team (HydroPatrol) managed to score as the runner-up solution amongst all 50+ competing teams.<br><br> 
                Our submission was part business model, part programming solution so we had team members working on the 
                both parts in parallel. We didn't manage to implement all that we had envisioned in the 3 day period 
                that we crunched the hackathon, yet we still got a solid satellite image processing pipeline going. 
                The idea was to use satellite images to monitor and visualize the presence of chlorophyll-a, present in 
                algae in waterbodies of Sweden. Providing usefull information for combating harmful algae blooms (HABs).

            Github repo
            <p> This repo contains some of the code that we developed for the hackathon,
                showcasing the satellite image processing pipeline along with some sample
                images in a python jupyter notebook.
